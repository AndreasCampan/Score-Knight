# Score-Knight

**Created By:** Andreas Campan
Free to use - Open source

**Purpose:** 
This app is an adaptation from my original ["scorekeeper"](https://github.com/AndreasCampan/Score-Keeper) which was a website app designed to help keep score for game nights. The original app was built using html css and vanilla js which worked great but it lacked many features such as creating a home icon for mobile devices or saving data to local storage incase of accidental page refresh. 

I decided to rebuild the app from ground up using React and potentially include the full MERN stack to allow users to save game sessions to a database. 

Score-Knight will also have an array of games to select from which will customize the player's cards accordingly generating only useful content.

The motivation and inspiration behind this app was my pregnant wife who told me “I hate using the notes app to keep score”
